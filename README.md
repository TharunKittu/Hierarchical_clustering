# Hierarchical_clustering
# PROJECT TITLE:

Analysis and prediction of "mall_customers.csv" of americial mall markets called as phonic mall to find out on the basis of client requirments of dendrogram using scipy graphics library with the help of 'scipy cluster.hierarchy' to ace the no.of linkage of clustering of predict.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

The american finance market clients as per the rate of gdp of 2011 found as highest no.of growth in their business market
As a datascience engineer findout which hierarchy cluster give maximum linkage in upcoming future.
# TASKS :
1. With the help of scipy library import libraries and datasets
2. using the dendrogram to find the optimal no.of cluster
3. Create hierarchy model and visualise the cluster with the help of matplot library

# CONCLUSION:
According to the model building as a engineer my prediction is cluster number 3 has highest number of linkage.

# INSIGHTS:
(1) Cluster1 contains (Red)color  which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance from Centroid upto AnnualIncome  approximately 139k$
(2) Cluster2 contains (blue)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance from Centroid upto AnnualIncome  approximately 79-80k$
(3) Cluster3 contains (green)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance from Centroid upto AnnualIncome  approximately 139k$
(4) Cluster4 contains (cyan)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance from Centroid upto AnnualIncome  approximately 40k
(5) Cluster5 contains (pink)color which shows that unsupervised learning cluster has maximum eucluid distance from Centroid upto AnnualIncome  approximatelyÂ 40k$
